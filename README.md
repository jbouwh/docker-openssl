# Build the latest OpenSSL by docker container.

### Using the Docker.io Cloud machine

### It's really awesome!

#### OS base on CentOS

``` centos:latest ```

### I don't know how to get the latest version of OpenSSL, like openssl-latest.tar.gz
### So I have to put the version here
## OPENSSL VERSION=```1.0.2d```
